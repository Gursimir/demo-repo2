⌨️ Copy the https or ssh code of the empty repository
⌨️ To add the reference to the remote repository use git remote add origin codeOfEmptyRepository command 
⌨️ To check that you are connected enter git remote -v command
⌨️ Once you are done with that u can puch the repository by entering the command git push origin master 
⌨️ To stop writting git push origin master again and again you can write git push -u origin master once and then use only git push command 
⌨️ now u can refresh the git to see your pushed repository
